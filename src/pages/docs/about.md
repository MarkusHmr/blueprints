### Why Blueprints?

The goal for this site is to increase the value of the Liferay brand. To do that, we need to accomplish three things:

1.  Improve execution
1.  Increase consistency
1.  Build awareness

For more on improvements to execution, read our [brand update](link-to-post). Weâ€™re providing a centralized repository of knowledge and a shared library of assets to make things more accessible to everyone to increase consistency. As we execute on those two points, we empower everyone to more effectively build awareness.

### Our Approach
