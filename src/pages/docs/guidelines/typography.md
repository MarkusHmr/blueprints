### Primary Typeface: Source Sans Pro

There are a number of qualities that make Source Sans Pro the obvious choice for Liferay:

* Support for over 21 languages (including [Chinese, Japanese, and Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Han_Sans))&mdash;critical for helping us stay consistent in [our offices all over the world](https://www.liferay.com/locations).
* Typeface for user interfaces&mdash;easy for people to read and use.
* [Open source](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro)&mdash;albeit by Adobe.
* Wide wariety of weights&mdash;helps us speak in the right way at the right place and context.

### Longform Text: Source Serif Pro
